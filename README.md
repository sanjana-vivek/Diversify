Endangered plants are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species, exacerbated by insufficient conservation efforts and limited public awareness. Urgent action is crucial to implement effective conservation measures and preserve the invaluable biodiversity and ecosystem services these plants provide.

 500+ People were surveyed across 5 cities
- The form was circulated among various age groups to ensure a collective opinion
-  Best efforts were made sure to reach people from various communities and parts of the country

<br>

Our survey results have uncovered a significant population residing in neighborhoods characterized by sparse greenery, presenting a substantial opportunity for growth in both area coverage and biodiversity. These individuals have expressed a keen interest in addressing this issue, yet have been uncertain about how to initiate action.
  
<br>

ðŸŒ¿ Our initiative seeks to foster environmental consciousness and biodiversity by providing a platform where plant enthusiasts can connect, learn, and contribute to the preservation of flora diversity. Recognizing the growing interest in plant care and the importance of safeguarding diverse plant species, our platform offers users a space to share knowledge, engage in community-driven projects, and access resources aimed at promoting biodiversity. Through our holistic approach, we aim to empower individuals to play an active role in environmental conservation, ultimately fostering a more sustainable future.
